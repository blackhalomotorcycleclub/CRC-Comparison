Write-Host "This script contains two functions: Get-CRC and Compare-CRC."
Write-Host "Get-CRC scans directories recursively and generates the CRC value for each file. It takes one mandatory parameter: `-Path` which specifies the directory to scan. The script will automatically generate an output file name based on the current date and time and save the resulting CRC values to that file. The output file name will be in the format `crc-yyyy-M-d.txt`, where `yyyy` is the current year, `M` is the current month, and `d` is the current day."
Write-Host "Compare-CRC compares the CRC values of files at a designated point in the filesystem. It takes three mandatory parameters: `-Path` which specifies the path of the text file containing the CRC values to compare, `-ComparePath` which specifies the path of the text file containing the CRC values to compare against, and `-OutputFile` which specifies the path of the text file to output the comparison results to. The function also takes two optional switches: `-Verbose` which displays detailed output and `-Silent` which only displays output in red text if any of the CRC values are mismatched."

Write-Host "You can run these functions individually by calling their respective scripts (Get-CRC.ps1 and Compare-CRC.ps1), or you can use a main script (Main.ps1) that can call all three scripts (including Show-Help.ps1). When run, Main.ps1 will display a menu with options to call each of these scripts. You can enter `1` to call Get-CRC.ps1, `2` to call Compare-CRC.ps1, or `3` to call Show-Help.ps1. The main script will then prompt you for any required parameters before calling the selected script."
